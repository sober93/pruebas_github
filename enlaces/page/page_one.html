		<p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans.
 			When roasted, the green coffee bean expands to nearly double its original size, changing
 			in color and density. As the bean absorbs heat, its color shifts to yellow, 
			then to a light "cinnamon" brown, and then to a rich dark brown color. 
			During roasting, oils appear on the surface of the bean. The roast will continue to 
			darken until it is removed from the heat source.</p>

		<p>Coffee can be roasted with ordinary kitchen equipment (frying pan, grill, oven, popcorn popper)
 			or by specialised appliances. A coffee roaster is a special pan or apparatus suitable to heat up
 			and roast green coffee beans.</p>

		<p>The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a large scale, but small-scale commercial roasting
 			has grown significantly with the trend toward "single-origin" coffees served at specialty shops. 
			Some coffee drinkers even roast coffee at home as a hobby in order to both experiment with the flavor
 			profile of the beans and ensure themselves of the freshest possible roast.</p>
